# timetrials repo
Allow people to scan a qr code and begin a race in a designated spot.  The beginning and ending points are geo-locked meaning the racer cannot hit start until they are in the starting "zone".  This is a web app that can just use the phones internet browser.  The session data (time stamps) is stored upon initiating the race.  The times are pulled from the server (not from the local device's clock) as to prevent sync issues (or cheating).
